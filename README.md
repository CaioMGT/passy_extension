# passy_extension

This will (eventually) be an extension that integrates with [Passy](https://github.com/GlitterWare/Passy) and allow autofill of passwords based on whatever is present on the server.  
This will be achieved by making use of an URL scheme to handle communication between client and server, abstracting away all the work with handling passwords to the server.

## Goals
Get some custom UI to display
Working autofill
Integration with [Passy](https://github.com/GlitterWare/Passy)
